# Overview

This is a Haskell combinator library implementing _open games_, a battery of examples, and a code generation tool for making the combinator library practical to work with.

This repo is a refactored and simplified implementation on the basis of [this](https://github.com/jules-hedges/open-game-engine) version by Jules Hedges. 

If you have questions, drop me (Philipp) a [mail](mailto:philipp.zahn@unisg.ch)!  

# Run the code

You can use `stack build` to compile the project, `stack test` will run the tests
`stack ghci` and `stack ghci --test` will run ghci using the main target or the test
targets respectively.


# Usage

There is a [tutorial](https://github.com/philipp-zahn/open-games-hs/blob/master/Tutorial/TUTORIAL.md) how to use the software for modelling.
